# Stock Pattern Recognition using CNN

## üìå Overview
This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically recognize and classify 14 different candlestick and chart patterns from stock market data. It is aimed at helping analysts or algorithms detect meaningful patterns that may indicate bullish or bearish trends.

---

## üìö Related Work & Research
Traditional technical analysis is heavily reliant on human interpretation, which often introduces bias and inconsistency. Several recent research works have attempted to apply deep learning techniques to automate this process:

- **DeepCandle (IEEE, 2020):** Introduced a CNN-based model to recognize a limited number (5) of candlestick patterns. The model lacks robustness due to the absence of augmentation, class balancing, and ignores the contextual influence of volume and trend. Reported accuracy was ~72%.

- **CNN-LSTM Hybrid (Elsevier, 2021):** Focused on stock price forecasting using a hybrid of convolutional and recurrent layers. While useful for forecasting, it does not address multi-class pattern classification in images, limiting its scope.

- **arXiv:2201.XXXX ‚Äì Pattern Recognition in Financial Charts (2022):** Focused on 6 basic candlestick patterns using simple CNNs. Dataset was small and imbalanced, with moderate results (~70%). No validation checks for pattern formation.

- **Financial Chart Pattern Recognition using Deep Learning (IEEE Access, 2023):** Employed a basic CNN architecture to classify chart patterns such as head and shoulders and triangles, achieving around 75% accuracy on unbalanced datasets.

### üöÄ What Makes This Project Unique?
- **Higher Accuracy:** Achieves ~85% accuracy across 14 well-distributed pattern classes through architecture tuning and robust preprocessing.
- **Pattern Diversity:** Recognizes both candlestick and chart patterns, unlike many works which focus on one type.
- **Volume & Confidence Checks:** Integrates additional checks during dataset creation to improve label reliability.
- **Balanced Dataset:** Uses class balancing and augmentation to avoid overfitting and class bias.
- **Realistic Dataset Generation:** Patterns are validated with sliding windows and market volume, simulating real-time trading environments.
